# Hydro-JULES Summer School 2024

Welcome to the Hydro-JULES Summer School multi-dimensional data workshops. This series of three workshops cover the basics of accessing and using multi-dimensional data. Summaries of the three workshops are provided below, along with links to the Python Jupyter Notebooks that we will be going through with you.

    <summary>If you are not attending the Summer School, please read this message.</summary>
These notebooks were provided as part of the Hydro-JULES summer school. This guidance was written for taking the participants through these notebooks using the JASMIN Notebook Service, where they would have access to the data. You are very welcome to go through these notebooks in your own time. These workshops are based on several excellent tutorials, which you will find links to.

## The high-level objectives of these linked workshops are to:
- Provide overviews of key Python packages related to processing of multi-dimensional data.
- Introduce you to the Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions.
- Introduce you to cloud object storage and related Python packages.
- Provide practice with practical applications of these standards and packages.

During workshops 4 and 5, we will be talking you through the associated notebooks. In the 6th workshop, you will have opportunity to work through a series of exercises in a notebook and ask further questions. We will be using Zoom to deliver these workshops, you will have been emailed joining links for each of the workshops. We look forward to meeting you.

If during the Summer School workshops you require assistance, please contact [Kit Macleod](mailto:kitmac@ceh.ac.uk) or [Amulya Chevuturi](mailto:amuche@ceh.ac.uk). 

To help get you set up for these three workshops, we provide:

ii. [Introduction to the workshop notebooks](#introduction-to-the-workshop-notebooks)


## Overview and introduction to using notebooks on JASMIN
[JASMIN](https://jasmin.ac.uk/) provides storage and compute facilities to enable data-intensive environmental science. It provides support for a wide range of data-intensive analysis workflows. It is designed and operated by the [Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC)](https://www.ukri.org/councils/stfc/) on behalf of the [Natural Environment Research Council [(NERC)](https://www.ukri.org/councils/nerc/). 

We will be using [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) on the [JASMIN Notebook Service](https://notebooks.jasmin.ac.uk/) JASMIN provide [guidance](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/docs/interactive-computing/jasmin-notebooks-service/) on what is a Jupyter Notebook, the [Jaspy Software Environments](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/docs/software-on-jasmin/jaspy-envs/) they provide, how to use the Notebook Service, and links to further learning resources. Please use the *Python 3 + Jaspy Kernel* to run your notebooks.
